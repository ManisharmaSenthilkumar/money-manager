Project Description:

Money Manager is a personal finance web application that helps users 
track income, expenses, transfers, and account balances. 
The dashboard provides weekly, monthly, and yearly summaries 
of income and expenditure along with recent transaction history.
 Users can add transactions through a modal with separate income
and expense tabs, categorize them (fuel, food, medical, etc.), and
assign divisions (Personal/Office). The application also supports filtering 
transactions by category, division, and date range. Reports page provides 
interactive charts such as trend graphs and category-wise spending analysis. 
Accounts page shows account balances and transfer history. 
All updates reflect across the application instantly since the data 
is stored in MongoDB Atlas and fetched through the backend API. 
The project is deployed with a public frontend and backend URL.
